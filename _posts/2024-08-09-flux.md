Last week, a new state-of-the-art text-to-image model called Flux was released by Black Forest Labs (the original creators of Stable Diffusion), which is open-sourced and offers capabilities comparable to Midjourney. Curious about its quality compared to other models, I conducted a quick one-shot generation test for the following models (prices are estimated based on official pricing websites and replicate.com):


| Model Name                        | Company              | Type          | Price per Image       |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| Flux Schnell                      | Black forest labs    | Open Source   | $0.003 / image        |
| Flux Pro                          | Black forest labs    | Open Source   | $0.055 / image        |
| Stable Diffusion 3                | Stability.ai         | Open Source   | $0.035 / image        |
| Dalle  3                          | OpenAI               | Closed Source | $0.040 / image        |
| Kling                             | KuaiShou             | Closed Source | $0.002 / image        |

I used the following prompt for general image with an artist style:

> a surreal landscape with floating islands and a giant glowing moon in the style of Hayao Miyazaki

and another prompt to test the text generation:

> gateau cake spelling out the words "Takin.AI", tasty, food photography, dynamic shot

The testing results are listed below.  

- For the first prompt, I prefer the Flux Schnell and Kling results, which are also the most affordable models.
- For the second prompt, I like the results from Flux Schnell and Dalle3 the most.

**FYI: You can use text2image models such as Flux, SD, SDXL, SD3, Dalle3, and ControlNets with one single account from [Takin.ai](https://takin.ai/) - start with a free account to try the examples in this post.**
