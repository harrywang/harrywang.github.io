Last week, a new state-of-the-art text-to-image model called Flux was released by Black Forest Labs (the original creators of Stable Diffusion), which is open-sourced and offers capabilities comparable to Midjourney. Curious about its quality compared to other models, I conducted one-shot generation test using the following prompt:

The models I tested are listed below:

| Model Name                        | Company              | Type          | Price per Image       |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| Flux Schnell                      | Black forest labs    | Open Source   | $0.003 / image        |
| Flux Pro                          | Black forest labs    | Open Source   | $0.055 / image        |
| Stable Diffusion 3                | Stability.ai         | Open Source   | $0.035 / image        |
| Dalle  3                          | OpenAI               | Closed Source | $0.040 / image        |
| Kling                             | KuaiShou             | Closed Source | $0.002 / image        |

The testing results are as follows - personally, I like the Flux Schnell and Kling results the best, which are also the cheapest models. 

Flux Schnell (fastest - only took 1.3 second):
