This post is also for myself - I often want to register packages to [https://www.npmjs.com/](https://www.npmjs.com/) and/or [https://pypi.org/](https://pypi.org/) and keep on looking for instructions that I forget. Please refer to the two great tutorials in the references section for details. I only list the key steps and notes that I often need to refer to below.

## Setup Github Repo for the Package

The easiest way to start is to find an example repo and revise the package information:

- [https://github.com/harrywang/greeter-node](https://github.com/harrywang/greeter-node) (NPM): package info in `package.json`
- [https://github.com/harrywang/greeter-python](https://github.com/harrywang/greeter-python) (PyPI): package name is

## Package and Publish

You need to register accounts on [https://www.npmjs.com/](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [https://pypi.org/](https://pypi.org/).

For NPM:

```
npm install
npm login
npm publish
```

Then, you should see your published package, e.g., [https://www.npmjs.com/package/harry-greeter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/harry-greeter)

For PyPI:

Find classifier (such as supported licenses) from [https://pypi.org/classifiers/](https://pypi.org/classifiers/) for `setup.py`, then:

```
python setup.py sdist
twine upload dist/*
```

Then, you should see your published package, e.g., [https://pypi.org/project/harrywang-greeter/](https://pypi.org/project/harrywang-greeter/)
