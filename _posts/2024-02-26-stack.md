In this post, I list the tech stack and related services that support our products at [Takin.ai](https://takin.ai/) and [HiddenArt.ai](https://hiddenart.ai/) and the things we tried but did not work.

### Frontend

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)/[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/):
    - [Pages Router (Old) vs. App Router (New)](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages): we used Pages router for one project and App Router for another project. It does not matter that much for the features I use so far - pick the one that your existing developers are most comfortable with and use a small project to push the team to learn the new features related to App Router
    - [tRPC](https://trpc.io/): tried but did not use given my team is not familiar with this and I am not sure about the additional benefits
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for CSS
- [Hero Icons](https://heroicons.com/): SVG icons
- [PlayWright](https://playwright.dev/) for front-end testing

Note that we use Nextjs [monorepo](https://blog.logrocket.com/build-monorepo-next-js/) to include projects on API, Blog, Admin, Gallery, etc.

### Backend

- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) for serverless database
- [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/): we used Qdrant to develop ChatPDF like features but switched to Weaviate for serverless - Qdrant has no serverless option and cannot be easily scaled down.
- [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/): our current vector database (Serverless Cloud Service)
- [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/) for searching functions
- [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for cloud object storage
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for Python backend
- [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) for hosting FastAPI backend in serverless
- [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api) for AI functions (both GPT 3.5 and 4)
- [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) for jumpstarting some PoC projects but not used for many products due to the extra unnecessary complexity for our scenarios.
- [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/) for data and model storage and some LLM integration such chatting using Llama 2
- [AWS GPU](https://aws.amazon.com/): we started with AWS GPU [G4 instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/g4/) - way too expensive - bought some reserved instances to help but ended up using Runpod for cheaper price and easier setup.
- [Runpod](https://www.runpod.io/) for Stable Diffusion backend hosting (great Stable Diffusion WebUI docker templates to choose from).  We are in the process to switch to Runpod serverless.
- [Replicate](https://replicate.com/): we tested a few APIs but have not integrated them with our systems yet. 
- [A1111 Stable Diffusion WebUI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui): our SD backend running in the API mode.

### Code

[Github](https://github.com/) for everything: code management and collaboration, issues, CI/CD

### Data Collection

- [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) for Python Scraper. See my tutorial: [A Minimalist End-to-End Scrapy Tutorial](https://harrywang.me/scrapy)
- [Zyte](https://www.zyte.com/) for hosting Scrapy spiders and avoiding banning.

### Analytics

- [Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/) for site analytics
- [MongoDB Charts](https://www.mongodb.com/products/charts) for basic BI dashboards

### Payment

[Stripe](https://stripe.com/) for everything related to payment

### Dev Tools

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Github Co-Pilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)

### CMS

[Headless Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) hosted on [SiteGround](https://www.siteground.com/) - see my other related post on [Headless Wordpress + Next.js + ElasticSearch](https://harrywang.me/wp) for more details.

### Domain Names

I register all my domains mainly from the following websites - NameCheap is cheaper with additional features. The DNS servers are then changed to SiteGround to use company email service and CMS.

- [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/)
- [NameCheap](www.namecheap.com)

### Email

- SiteGround for free company emails, such as support@takin.ai - see my other related post on [Setup Websites using SiteGround](https://harrywang.me/wp) for more details.
- [AWS SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) for programmatic email service

### Misc Tools

- [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for running WebUI server behind firewall
- [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) for screen recording and sharing

Hope this can provide some useful information for you.
