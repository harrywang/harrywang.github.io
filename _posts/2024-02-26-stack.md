In this post, I list the tech stack and related services that support our products at [Takin.ai](https://takin.ai/) and [HiddenArt.ai](https://hiddenart.ai/) and the things we tried but did not work.

Changelog:

March 2025:

- [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/) for AI-powered coding
- [Neon](https://neon.tech) for serverless PostgreSQL database
- [TiDB](https://www.pingcap.com/) for serverless MySQL database
- [ShadCN](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for UI components
- [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) for proxy and SSL
- [Preset](https://preset.io/) for BI.

January 2025:

- Switched from MongoDB to PostgreSQL using Prisma: we did this to unify our backend databases to PostgreSQL for easy maintenance and development.
- Updated Nextjs to use App Router instead of Pages Router

November 2024: 

- Switched from AWS to DigitalOcean for hosting: AWS is getting so complicated for simple hosting services we need.
- Switched from AWS SES to Postmark: I hope we did this earlier
- Switched from Weaviate to self-hosted PostgreSQL with pgvecor to lower cost and simplify our stack

### Frontend

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)/[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/):
    - [Pages Router (Old) vs. App Router (New)](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages): we used Pages router for one project and App Router for another project. It does not matter that much for the features I use so far - pick the one that your existing developers are most comfortable with and use a small project to push the team to learn the new features related to App Router
- [ShadCN](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for UI components
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for CSS
- [PlayWright](https://playwright.dev/) for front-end testing

Note that we use Nextjs [monorepo](https://blog.logrocket.com/build-monorepo-next-js/) to include projects on API, Blog, Admin, Gallery, etc.

### Backend

Now:

- [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/): hosting service switched from AWS.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/): self-hosted for backend database to start then switch to Neon.
- [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector): PostgreSQL extension to support vector similarity search.
- [Neon](https://neon.tech): serverless PostgreSQL
- [TiDB](https://www.pingcap.com/) for serverless MySQL database
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) and [Vercel KV](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-kv): Redis database for storing chat conversation and Dify integration
- [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for cloud object storage
- [Replicate](https://replicate.com/): used as the backend models for most of text-to-image generation tools.
- [e2b](https://e2b.dev/): used as the cloud sandbox for executing code.
- [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) for proxy and SSL.

Previously:

- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) for serverless database
- MongoDB: self-hosted NoSQL database on DigitalOcean
- [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/): we used Qdrant to develop ChatPDF like features but switched to Weaviate for serverless - Qdrant has no serverless option and cannot be easily scaled down.
- [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/): our current vector database (Serverless Cloud Service)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) and [Vercel KV](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-kv): Redis database for storing chat conversation and Dify integration
- [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/) for searching functions
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for Python backend
- [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) for hosting FastAPI backend in serverless
- [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api) for AI functions (both GPT 3.5 and 4)
- [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) for jumpstarting some PoC projects but not used for many products due to the extra unnecessary complexity for our scenarios.
- [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/) for data and model storage and some LLM integration such chatting using Llama 2
- [AWS GPU](https://aws.amazon.com/): we started with AWS GPU [G4 instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/g4/) - way too expensive - bought some reserved instances to help but ended up using Runpod for cheaper price and easier setup.
- [Runpod](https://www.runpod.io/) for Stable Diffusion backend hosting (great Stable Diffusion WebUI docker templates to choose from).  We are in the process to switch to Runpod serverless.
- [A1111 Stable Diffusion WebUI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui): our SD backend running in the API mode.

### Code

[Github](https://github.com/) for everything: code management and collaboration, issues, CI/CD

### Data Collection

- [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) for Python Scraper. See my tutorial: [A Minimalist End-to-End Scrapy Tutorial](https://harrywang.me/scrapy)
- [Zyte](https://www.zyte.com/) for hosting Scrapy spiders and avoiding banning.

### Analytics

- [Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/) for site analytics
- [Preset](https://preset.io/) for BI.

Previously:
- [MongoDB Charts](https://www.mongodb.com/products/charts) for basic BI dashboards

### Payment

[Stripe](https://stripe.com/) for everything related to payment

### Dev Tools

[Windsurf](https://codeium.com/) for AI-powered coding with Github MCP integration

Previously:
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Github Co-Pilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)

### CMS

[Headless Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) hosted on [SiteGround](https://www.siteground.com/) - see my other related post on [Headless Wordpress + Next.js + ElasticSearch](https://harrywang.me/wp) for more details.

### Domain Names

I register all my domains mainly from the following websites - NameCheap is cheaper with additional features. The DNS servers are then changed to SiteGround to use company email service and CMS.

- [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/)
- [NameCheap](www.namecheap.com)

### Email

Now:

- [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/) for sending emails via API with templates
- Namecheap Business Email for company emails

Previously:

- [AWS SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) for programmatic email service
- SiteGround for free company emails, such as support@takin.ai - see my other related post on [Setup Websites using SiteGround](https://harrywang.me/wp) for more details.

### Misc Tools

- [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for running WebUI server behind firewall
- [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) for screen recording and sharing

Hope this can provide some useful information for you.
