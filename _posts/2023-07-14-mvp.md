Update (10/7/2023): I revised another "ChatPDF" app using LangChain and Qdrant [here](https://github.com/harrywang/pdf-ai-assistant).

I revised the [sample chatbot kickstarter app](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/tree/main/apps/chatbot-kickstarter) developed by [Colin Jarvis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/colin-jarvis-50019658/) from OpenAI, which shows how you can create apps (Q&A and Chatbot) using ChatGPT and your own data.

Instead of using the well-known term [RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/), I created a new acronym for this common architecture:

> MVP: M (large language Model) + V (Vector database) + P (Prompt engineering)

If a fine-tuned LLM is used, then it is FMVP (Fine-tuned MVP).

My revised code repo with setup instructions is [here](https://github.com/harrywang/chatbot-kickstarter).

## Data

I used the rulebooks from NBA and IFAB for the demo.

- [NBA Official Rulebook 2022-23 ](https://ak-static.cms.nba.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/10/Official-Playing-Rules-2022-23-NBA-Season.pdf)
- [IFAB (International Football Association Board) Laws of the Game 2023-2024](https://www.theifab.com/laws-of-the-game-documents/) - I removed all images in the PDF to reduce the file size.

If you want to use other data, just put the PDF files in `data` folder.

## Key Steps

I list the basic steps of the development workflow below - many of the steps have nothing to do with ChatGPT:

Preparation:

- Split documents (PDF files in this example, which are extracted into text files) into chunks (300 in this example)
- Get the text embeddings of the chunks (OpenAI `text-embedding-ada-002` is used but this can be replaced by any text embedding API/Package)
- Store the chunks in the vector database (Redis is used but we used [Milvus](https://milvus.io/) and [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) in production). 

Q&A (single-turn chat via [Completion endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions)):

- Get user query (such as 'what is a penalty kick') and generate the text embedding of the query
- Use the query embedding to search for text chunk embeddings stored in the vector database and get the Top N search results
- Ask ChatGPT to answer the question based on the Top N search results and summarize it using a bulleted list - this is the prompt engineering part

```
summary_prompt = '''Summarise this result in a bulleted list to answer the search query a customer has sent.
Search query: SEARCH_QUERY_HERE
Search result: SEARCH_RESULT_HERE
Summary:
'''
```

Chatbot (multi-turn chat via [Chat Completion endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat)):

- Use the system prompt to guide the behavior of the ChatGPT, such as telling the role of the Chatbot as a sports knowledge base assistant
- Use the system prompt to tell ChatGPT to ask for the type of sport if not presented in the query
- Use the system prompt to say a trigger word/phase ("searching for answers" in this demo) for downstream tasks (search the vector database for answers - this could be anything, e.g., book a dinner, post to Instagram, do a Google search)
- All previous messages are appended to the next API call to ChatGPT to provide context

```
system_prompt = '''
You are a helpful sports knowledge base assistant. You need to capture a Question and Sport from each customer.
The Question is their query on sports rules, and the Sport should be either basketball or soccer.
Think about this step by step:
- The user will ask a Question
- You will ask them for the Sport if their question didn't include a Sport
- Once you have the Sport, say "searching for answers".

Example:

User: I'd like to know how many players are on each team

Assistant: Certainly, what sport would you like this for?

User: basketball please.

Assistant: Searching for answers.

```
