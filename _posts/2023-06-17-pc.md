I replaced my old 2080ti GPU with a 4090 in my remote server and built a PC so that I can still use the 2080ti locally. I followed [this great YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUu7N8tq4RE) and the process was quite easy.

I bought all parts from Amazon and the total is $583:
- Motherboard: [MSI B550-A PRO ProSeries Motherboard](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B089CZSQB4/) - $140
- CPU: [AMD Ryzenâ„¢ 5 5600 with Cooler](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09VCHR1VH/) - $129
- RAM (16G): [T-Force Vulcan Z DDR4 16GB Kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07T637L7T/) - $34
- SSD (2T): [Kingston NV2 2TB M.2 2280 NVMe Internal SSD](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BDTC589G/) - $85
- Power Supply Unit (PSU): [750W Fully Modular RGB Power Supply](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BWJMDR6N/) - $80
- Case: [NZXT H5 Flow Compact ATX Mid-Tower PC Gaming Case - White](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B6YHDB2Y) - $95
- USB Wifi: [TP-Link AC1300 USB WiFi Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P6N2TZH) - $20

I then made a bootable USB from ISO image using [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) and installed Windows 11. The PC is very quiet and nice-looking :).
