I see more Python projects are using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage packages and dependencies and want to learn what Poetry is and why it's better than (pip + venv). 

I found this [article](https://medium.com/@pdx.lucasm/python-poetry-f8cbab0eef94) very useful, which has a nice comparison between poetry vs. pip + venv.

A quick summary based on my learning: 

- for simple projects, pip + venv works just fine - it comes with Python, no additional learning or setup needed.
- for complex projects, poetry has features that make the package and dependency management easier, such as no manual maintenance of various `requirements.txt` files. 

The following are some of my notes. 

### Installation


Install `pipx`:

```
brew install pipx
pipx ensurepath
sudo pipx ensurepath --global
```

Install/upgrade/uninstall Poetry:

```
pipx install poetry
pipx upgrade poetry
pipx uninstall poetry
```

### Setup a Repo with Poetry

Create a repo as usual, clone the repo, and initialize with Poetry:

```
git clone https://github.com/harrywang/self-contained-python-repo-poetry.git
cd self-contained-python-repo-poetry/
poetry init
```

`poetry init` will guide you through creating your `pyproject.toml` config.


Now add/remove packages using `poetry add`/`poetry remove` (`.venv` is created in the project folder):

```
poetry add openai tqdm torch torchvision python-dotenv
```

which outputs:

```
% poetry add openai tqdm torch torchvision python-dotenv
Creating virtualenv self-contained-python-repo-poetry in /Users/harrywang/sandbox/self-contained-python-repo-poetry/.venv
Using version ^1.35.13 for openai

Updating dependencies
Resolving dependencies... (5.2s)
...

```

If you need to use the shell with virtual environment activated:

```
poetry shell
```

If you need the `requirements.txt` file for frameworks or systems that rely on that file (see [docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#export)):

```
poetry export --output requirements.txt
poetry export --without-hashes --output requirements.txt
```

If you clone a repo with poetry setup, you can install the packages: `poetry install`
