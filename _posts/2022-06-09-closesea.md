I developed and deployed **CloseSea: the smallest NFT marketplace** :) based on the great [tutorial](https://dev.to/edge-and-node/building-scalable-full-stack-apps-on-ethereum-with-polygon-2cfb) by [Nader Dabit](https://twitter.com/dabit3).

I added a few things on top of Nader's tutorial:

- how to add NFT traits in metadata and how they will be displayed on OpenSea
- how to manage the contract as a owner, e.g., change the listing fee and withdraw the money from the contract address
- how to verify the contract, estimate gas, and deploy the app to Vercel

You can play with the demo at [https://closesea-one.vercel.app/](https://closesea-one.vercel.app/), which uses the contract deployed on [Rinkeby](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xf8b580081eC9b00d6A43e29747BE3D19898a1961) - you need to connect your wallet, switch to Rinkeby network, and use [test Rinkeby eth](https://harrywang.me/get-eth) to list and trade.

The listed/minted NFTs can be seen at [https://testnets.opensea.io/collection/closesea-collection](https://testnets.opensea.io/collection/closesea-collection).

The code and docs can be accessed at [Repo](https://github.com/harrywang/closesea).

The followings are used in this project:

- Solidity
- Hardhat
- Alchemy
- Rinkeby/Mumbai/Polygon
- OpenZeppelin
- Ethers.js
- Next.js
- TailwindCSS
