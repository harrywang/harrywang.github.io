I find I have to tell developers (sometimes even developers with a few years' experience) again and again how to properly manage environment variables - so I write this simple post so that I can just send a link.

### Don'ts

Don'ts: **DO NOT** ever write the keys in your code - you will forget and push the keys to your repo. 

### Dos

Do one of the followings (I use `OPENAI_API_KEY` as an example and my preferred way is method 2):

1. use `export` command

- Open terminal and run `export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxx`
- Test that key is correctly set as an environment variable

    ```
    import os

    if os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY") is not None:
        print("OPENAI_API_KEY is ready")
    else:
        print("OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable not found")
    ```

2. use `.env` file

- create a `.env` file in the root of the project folder to store the environment variables - this file is gitignored by default (or add this file to `.gitignore`)

- create `requirements.txt` and include packages to install by putting the following lines in the file (two packages as examples):

    ```
    openai
    python-dotenv
    ```

- create a virtual environment and install the packages specified in `requirements.txt`:

    ```
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

- load keys from `.env` file:

    ```
    import openai
    import os
    from dotenv import load_dotenv

    load_dotenv()
    openai.api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
    ```

Method 2 above is my preferred way especially when you have many environment variables to manage.
