As a summer project during the COVID-19 pandemic, I designed and built a minimalist modern shed, which is 8' x 10' with a slanted roof (8' tall wall and 7' short wall).

## Video and Photos

I recorded the project using time lapse. The 5-minute video can be viewed at: [Youtube](https://youtu.be/aA54O99xAwA) and [Meipai](http://www.meipai.com/media/1225115152).
