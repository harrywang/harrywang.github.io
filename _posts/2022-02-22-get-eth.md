title: Get Test Ethers using Selenium

I needed some test ethers for Rinkeby and found out that the faucet is not working (I also don't like that you have to tweet to get the ethers):

<img class="mx-auto" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/get-eth/error.png">

Then, I found [https://www.rinkebyfaucet.com/](https://www.rinkebyfaucet.com/), which gives 0.1 test ether for each address per day: 

<img class="mx-auto" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/get-eth/faucet.png">

I wrote a program to control the browser (via Selenium) to get test ethers and scheduled the program to run every 24 hours using AWS EC2. Now, I am getting some test ethers automatically every day :).

The code reop can be accessed [here](https://github.com/harrywang/send-me-eth).

I use this program to illustrate the followings:

- Automate browsers using Selenium
- Send emails using SendGrid
- Schedule scripts using `crontab`
- Use `.env` to manage environment variables
- Deploy scheduled tasks on AWS EC2 instances

## Local Setup

Clone the repo, go to the repo folder, setup the virtual environment, and install the required packages:

```
git clone https://github.com/harrywang/send-me-eth.git
cd send-me-eth
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Register a free account at [https://sendgrid.com/](https://sendgrid.com/) and get the API key.

You then need to create a `.env` file in the root project folder and add the following lines (you can delete WALLET_ADDRESSES if you only use one address):

```
WALLET_ADDRESS='your wallet address'
WALLET_ADDRESSES='["wallet address 1", "wallet address 2", "wallet address 3"]'
SENDGRID_API_KEY='your sendgrid api key'
FROM_EMAIL='your sendgrid from email'
TO_EMAIL='the email you want to send notification to'
```

If you use multiple wallet addresses, change `multi_addresses = False` to `multi_addresses = True` in `send-me-eth.py`.

Then, run `python send-me-eth.py` every 24 hours to get 0.1 eth each time. Next, I explain the code and show how to deploy the script to AWS so that you don't have to manually run this every day.

## Code 

Environment variables (especially sensitive information such as API tokens, passwords, etc.) should never be hardcoded in the source code. One way to manage the environment variables is to put them in a `.env` file and load the variables using [dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) package. 

**NOTE**: make sure to put `.env` in the `.gitignore` file. 

- `.env` example for simple value variable or multiple value variable

```
WALLET_ADDRESS='your wallet address'
WALLET_ADDRESSES='["wallet address 1", "wallet address 2", "wallet address 3"]'
```

- install dotenv: `pip install python-dotenv`
- import it: `from dotenv import load_dotenv`
- load environment variables (use json.loads to load multiple value variable):

```python
import json

load_dotenv()
WALLET_ADDRESS = os.getenv('WALLET_ADDRESS')
WALLET_ADDRESSES = json.loads(os.getenv('WALLET_ADDRESSES'))
...
```

Setup Selenium using [webdriver-manager](https://pypi.org/project/webdriver-manager/):

- install: `pip install webdriver_manager`
- setup Chrome drive with options. You can comment out options when testing locally so that a chrome browser can pop up.

```python
s = Service(ChromeDriverManager().install())
op = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
op.add_argument('--headless')  # set headless mode - the browser won't show
op.add_argument('--window-size=1920,1080')  # set the browser size
driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=s, options=op)
```

The rest of the code is very straightforward:

- load the website via Selenium
- find the textbox and enter the address
- find the button and click
- pause 10 seconds to repeat with another address
- send an email to notify the completion of the script

## Schedule the task using cron

[Cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) (the word “Cron” comes from the Greek word “Chronos”, which means time) is a job scheduler on Unix-like operating systems to schedule jobs to run periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals.

`crontab` (stands for “cron table”) command can be used to schedule the task. A cron schedule expression has five fields: minute, hour, day of month, month, day of week

You can use [https://crontab.guru/](https://crontab.guru/) to help edit the expression. For example: 

- `*/1 * * * *` means running the task every minute
- `5 */24 * * *` means running the task at minute 5 past every 24th hour.


Run `crontab -e` to add the following line to the file (I choose vim as the editor), save the file (press ESC, then type `:wq`) and you have scheduled a task.

`*/1 * * * * python /full-path-to-the-file/send-me-eth.py`

Use `crontab -l` to check the running task and you should get an email every minute as a test. To stop the task, you just need to run `crontab -e` again to delete the line corresponding to the task.


## Deploy to AWS EC2

Create an AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance [here](https://aws.amazon.com/):

- Ubuntu 20.04 (x86)
- t2.micro (free tier)
- security group with SSH port 22 inbound enabled - outbound default all open
- create a new RSA key pair and download the `.cer` file

Once the instance is running, right-click the instance to get the server address:

<img class="mx-auto" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/get-eth/connect.png">

On the local computer, switch to the folder where the `.cer` key file is saved and connect to the server:

```
chmod 400 aws-gmail.cer
ssh -i "aws-gmail.cer" ubuntu@ec2-54-227-212-97.compute-1.amazonaws.com
```

Once logged in, clone the repo from the remote Ubuntu prompt:

```
git clone https://github.com/harrywang/send-me-eth.git
cd send-me-eth/
```

Then create a `.env` file and enter the environment variables (see above) 

```
vim .env  # create .env file
```

Install/upgrade required packages (Python 3.8.10 is the default):

```
python3 --version
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install --upgrade requests
```

Install Chrome:

```
sudo apt install wget
wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
sudo apt-get install -f  # run this if run into problem installing chrome
sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
```

Now, you can test the script by running `python3 send-me-eth.py` - you should receive an email. 

Next, use `crontab` to schedule the task as described above.

Check the paths of the default python and the script:

```
which python3
/usr/bin/python3
pwd
/home/ubuntu/send-me-eth
```

run `crontab -e` to add the following line to the file:

`*/1 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /home/ubuntu/send-me-eth/send-me-eth.py`

Use `crontab -l` to check the running task:

```
$ crontab -l
*/1 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /home/ubuntu/send-me-eth/send-me-eth.py
```

You should get an email every minute as a test. 

Finally, you can change the task to run at minute 5 past every 24th hour:

`5 */24 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /home/ubuntu/send-me-eth/send-me-eth.py`

Now, you can close the terminal and automatically get 0.1 ether (or more if multiple addresses are used) every day :). Make sure to delete the cron task when you get enough test ethers.
