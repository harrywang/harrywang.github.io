**TL;DR:** Hereâ€™s the full [PDF](/assets/files/ai-agent-harrywang.pdf) of my webinar presentation on AI agents and agentic workflows at the [UD FinTech Innovation Hub](https://www.udel.edu/research-innovation/star/fintech/) on March 12, 2025.

One of my goals is to present my understanding of LLM chatbots, agents, and agentic workflows through demos I developed, rather than using abstract definitions. I came up with the analogy between animal/human/nexus and chatbot/agent/workflow while reading the book *Nexus* last year, which I think is a clear and simple way to think about these concepts:

I also discuss how no-code and low-code AI agent tools are empowering business professionals to tackle many tasks once reserved to technical experts, and why a three-tiered approach to AI training is essential for organizations to build true AI readiness.
