**TL;DR:** Hereâ€™s the <a href="/assets/files/ai-agent-harrywang.pdf" target="_blank">full PDF presentation</a> from my webinar at the [UD FinTech Innovation Hub](https://www.udel.edu/research-innovation/star/fintech/) on AI agents and agentic workflows.

One of my goals is to demonstrate my understanding of LLM chatbots, agents, and agentic workflows through demos I developed, rather than using abstract definitions.

I came up with the analogy between animal/human/nexus and chatbot/agent/workflow while reading Nexus last year, which I think is a clear and simple way to understand these concepts:
