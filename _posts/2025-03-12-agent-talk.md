**TL;DR:** Hereâ€™s the <a href="/assets/files/ai-agent-harrywang.pdf" target="_blank">full PDF presentation</a> from my webinar at the [UD FinTech Innovation Hub](https://www.udel.edu/research-innovation/star/fintech/) on AI agents and agentic workflows. You can also view the PDF online by scrolling to the bottom of this page.

One of my goals is to demonstrate my understanding of LLM chatbots, agents, and agentic workflows through demos I developed, rather than using abstract definitions.

I came up with the analogy between animal/human/nexus and chatbot/agent/workflow while reading Nexus last year, which I think is a clear and simple way to understand these concepts:
