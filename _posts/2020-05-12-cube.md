**The Cube of Changes** is an art installation I designed for Burning Man 2020. I drew inspiration from [I Ching](/iching), the ancient Chinese geography concept “Round Sky and Square Earth” (appeared at least two thousand years ago), and works by James Turrell.

Unfortunately, my design did not pass the first round review for the Black Rock City Art Honorarium program and Burning Man 2020 has also been canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, I had lots of fun designing the cube and building the prototype.

### 3D Model

I asked my childhood friend Professor Xinnan Zhang (Chair of the Architecture Department at Tianjin University) to help with the 3D model, which you can view at [sketchup.com](https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model/3c7b991d-e9e8-42e1-a3e7-3c42cfe75b33/Round-Sky-Square-Earth). 

### The Prototype

I started to make this prototype in October 2019.

I burned this prototype in Philadelphia with friends on September 5, 2020 (2020 Burn Night).
