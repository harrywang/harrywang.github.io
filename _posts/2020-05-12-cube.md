*The Cube of Changes* is an art installation I designed for Burning Man 2020. I drew inspiration from I Ching, the ancient Chinese geography concept “Round Sky and Square Earth” (appeared at least two thousand years ago), and works by James Turrell.

Unfortunately, my design did not pass the first round review for the Black Rock City Art Honorarium program and Burning Man 2020 has also been canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, I had lots of fun designing the cube and building the prototype :).
