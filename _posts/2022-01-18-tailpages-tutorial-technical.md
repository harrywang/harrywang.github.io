[Tailpages (Tailwind + Github Pages)](https://harrywang.me/2022/01/20/tailpages.html) is a Jekyll website template based on TailwindCSS, which can be hosted by Github for free. You can visit the [demo site](https://harrywang.me/tailpages/).

This is a technical tutorial to show how to setup the development environment for Tailpages from scratch. Another no-code tutorial shows how you can use Tailpages template to quickly setup your website and blogs without coding, which you can access at [medium](https://harrywang.medium.com/introducing-tailpages-tailwind-github-pages-89903c52d3ec) or [blog](http://harrywang.me/2022/01/19/tailpages-tutorial-nocode.html).

Let's get started by creating an empty Github repo: 

<img class="mx-auto w-3/4" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/595772/148700857-a054dc43-ba82-4913-9635-cd314a8f74b2.png">

Fork and clone the repo on your computer and go to the cloned folder: 

```
git clone https://github.com/harrywang/tailpages.git
cd tailpages
```

## Setup Jekyll

**NOTE**: for Mac M1 users: follow [this](https://www.earthinversion.com/blogging/how-to-install-jekyll-on-appple-m1-macbook/) to install jekyll ARM compatible version:

```bash
xcode-select --install
brew upgrade
brew install rbenv ruby-build
rbenv install 3.1.2
rbenv global 3.1.2
ruby -v
rbenv rehash
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init - zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init - bash)"' >> ~/.bash_profile
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin:/usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/3.1.2/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin:/usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/3.1.2/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

**RESTART** the terminal and install the gems in the environment (no `sudo` needed):

```
gem install jekyll bundler
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

create a new Jekyll site: `jekyll new tailpages`, which create a `tailpages` folder within the repo folder:

move all files in the `tailpages` folder created by Jekyll one level up and then remove the folder:

```
mv tailpages/* .
rm -rf tailpages
```

After this, your folder structure should look like:

<img width="252" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-09 at 3 35 28 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/595772/148701238-cc1cba0d-45c5-4d18-ac78-402fdd73f473.png">


Open `Gemfile` file and add a Jekyll plugin we will need for processing Tailwind:

```
group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem 'jekyll-postcss-v2'
end
```

Now, you can test the site locally:

- at the root of this repo folder run `bundle install`
- run `bundle add webrick` according to https://github.com/github/pages-gem/issues/752
- run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
- Open it in your browser: `http://localhost:4000`


## Setup TailwindCSS

Add TailwindCSS:

```bash
yarn init -y
yarn add -D tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest postcss-cli
```

Create `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` by running `yarn tailwindcss init -p`

We use Tailwindcss [Typography plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) and [Inter font family](https://tailwindui.com/documentation) to style Markdown. I also modify the default Typography CSS to make the code style look better.  

Add typography plugin and the font:

```
yarn add -D @tailwindcss/typography
yarn add @fontsource/inter
```

Then, enable typography plugin, inter font, and customizations by updating `tailwid.config.js` as follows:

```js
const defaultTheme = require('tailwindcss/defaultTheme')

module.exports = {
  content: [
    './**/*.html'
  ],
  darkMode: 'media',
  theme: {
    extend: {
      typography: {...},
      fontFamily: {
        sans: ['Inter var', ...defaultTheme.fontFamily.sans],
      },
    },
  },

  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
  ],

}
```

**NOTE**: If this is your first time with Tailwind (just like me), you should know that Tailwind is "just-in-time", i.e., Tailwind CSS is generated on-demand as you develop your html pages/templates instead of being generated in advance at initial build time. For example, if you specify `content: ['./**/*.html']` in `tailwind.config.js` as shown above, the just-in-time engine scans all html files in this folder and generates the used styles into a tailwind output css file. For example, if you never used `m-6` in any html file - it won't be outputted into the file. 


Now we are ready to generate the Tailwind CSS file. First, create a new CSS file at `/assets/css/main.css` with the following content:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind utilities;
@tailwind components;
```

Then run `npx tailwindcss -i ./assets/css/main.css -o ./assets/css/tailwind.css --watch` to build the css file at `./assets/css/tailwind.css`. `--watch` makes sure that the css is regenerated whenever a change is detected in HTML files. 

Now, we can add a default layout HTML file to use Tailwind css at `_layouts/default.html`. Note that I also use [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for the icons and [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) for code highlighting.

```html
<head>
  ...
  <!-- TailwindCSS and Inter Font-->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/css/main.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/css/tailwind.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://rsms.me/inter/inter.css">

  <!-- fontawesome -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.15.4/css/all.css"
    integrity="sha384-DyZ88mC6Up2uqS4h/KRgHuoeGwBcD4Ng9SiP4dIRy0EXTlnuz47vAwmeGwVChigm" crossorigin="anonymous">
  
    <!-- highlight.js -->
   <link rel="stylesheet"
    href="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.4.0/styles/github-dark-dimmed.min.css">
  <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.4.0/highlight.min.js"></script>
  <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>

 </head>
```

## Page Templates

`_layouts` folder has all page templates, which may include page components, such as Navigation menu, footer, social media icons from files in `_includes` folder: 

- `default.html` is the base template that all other templates use
- `home.html` is the template for the Homepage
- `page.html` is the template for different pages
- `post.html` is the template for blog posts
- `tag.html` is the template for the tag page

## Customize Homepage and Add Pages/Blogs

You can refer to part I of this tutorial for how to customize the homepage and add new pages/blogs.

## Github Pages Settings

you have to change `baseurl` and `url` in `_config.yml` to make the site work for Github Pages:

```
baseurl: "/tailpages" # your repo name
url: "https://harrywang.github.io" # replace this with your username
```

Now, you can test the site: `jekyll serve` and open `http://127.0.0.1:4000/tailpages/` note now the address includes the `baseurl`, you should see the markdown file is styled with beautiful TailwindCSS.

## Host with Github Pages

You just need to commit all changes and push to the repo. Then, enable Github Pages and you should be able to visit your site at `https://<username>.github.io/<your-repo>`, such as `https://harrywang.github.io/tailpages` (note that I used a custom domain in the following screenshot):
