Hi, my name is Harry Wang (Chinese: 王建楠). I am a Full Professor of Management Information Systems at the [University of Delaware](https://lerner.udel.edu/) with more than 18 years' research, teaching, and management experience in AI, Data Science, Business Process Management, and Enterprise Systems. I am also an affiliated faculty at the [Data Science Institute](https://dsi.udel.edu/) and the [Institute for Financial Services Analytics](https://lerner.udel.edu/centers/institute-for-financial-services-analytics/).

I currently serve as the Founder and CEO of [Takin.ai](https://takin.ai/), a platform dedicated to supporting the teaching and learning of Generative AI. I was the Chief Scientist of [Tezign Inc.](https://en.tezign.com/) (a unicorn startup based in Shanghai) and an Independent Director for [So-Young International Inc.](https://ir.soyoung.com/) (NASDAQ: SY). I also served as the Founding Director of [OneConnect](https://www.ocft.com/en/) (NYSE: OCFT) U.S. Research Institute based in New York City from 2018 to 2019 and the VP of Technology for the [Association for Information Systems](https://aisnet.org/) from 2015 to 2018. I was one of the founding members of the Institute for Financial Services Analytics at the University of Delaware and a JPMorgan Chase Fellow from 2014 to 2018. I also founded Conferency in 2015 to provide SaaS solutions for academic conferences.

My recent research interests include Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Social Computing, and Human-Computer Interaction. My research has been published in academic journals, such as Management Information Systems Quarterly, Information Systems Research, INFORMS Journal on Computing, and Decision Support Systems.

In my spare time, I enjoy coding, sports, music, design, art, and woodworking. I created a brand `KU` (which means warehouse in Chinese) for my woodworking projects for fun: [KuWarehouse.com](http://kuwarehouse.com).
