# About Me

Hi, my name is Harry Wang (Chinese: 王建楠). I am a Full Professor of Management Information Systems at the [University of Delaware](https://www.udel.edu/) with more than 15 years' research, teaching, and management experience in AI, business intelligence and analytics, business process management, and enterprise systems. I currently also serve as the chief scientist of [Tezign](https://www.tezign.com) (a tech startup based in Shanghai, China backed by VC firms like Sequoia Capital and Hearst Ventures). I was the founding Director of [OneConnect](https://www.ocft.com/) (NYSE: OCFT) US Research Institute based in New York City from 2018 to 2019 and the VP of Technology for the [Association for Information Systems](https://aisnet.org/) from 2015 to 2018. I founded [Conferency](https://www.conferency.com/) (an open-source academic conference management system) in 2015 and enjoy coding, sports, music, design and art, and woodworking :).
