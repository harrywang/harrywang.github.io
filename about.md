Hi, my name is Harry Wang (Chinese: 王建楠). I am a Full Professor of Management Information Systems at the [University of Delaware](https://lerner.udel.edu/) with more than 18 years' research, teaching, and management experience in AI, Data Science, Social Computing, and Enterprise Systems. I am also an affiliated faculty at the [Data Science Institute](https://dsi.udel.edu/) and the [Institute for Financial Services Analytics](https://lerner.udel.edu/centers/institute-for-financial-services-analytics/).

I currently serve as the Founder and CEO of [Takin.ai](https://takin.ai/), a platform tailored for teaching and learning Generative AI with open-source tools. Previously, I was the Chief Scientist of [Tezign Inc.](https://en.tezign.com/) (a unicorn startup based in Shanghai) and an Independent Director for [So-Young International Inc.](https://ir.soyoung.com/) (NASDAQ: SY). I also served as the Founding Director of [OneConnect](https://www.ocft.com/en/) (NYSE: OCFT) U.S. Research Institute based in New York City from 2018 to 2019 and the VP of Technology for the [Association for Information Systems](https://aisnet.org/) from 2015 to 2018. I was one of the founding members of the Institute for Financial Services Analytics at the University of Delaware and a JPMorgan Chase Fellow from 2014 to 2018. I also founded Conferency in 2015 to provide SaaS solutions for academic conferences. My research has been published in top academic journals, such as Management Information Systems Quarterly, Information Systems Research, Production and Operations Management, Journal on Computing, and Decision Support Systems.

In my spare time, I enjoy coding, sports, music, design, art, and woodworking. I created a brand `KU` (which means warehouse in Chinese) for my woodworking projects for fun: [KuWarehouse.com](http://kuwarehouse.com).
